# ZeroClock
Transform your raspberry pi-zero in an alarm clock with e-ink display.

Eink technology has always had for me a certain fascination. The idea of having a screen that maintains an image indefinitely and without energy cost, linked to a high readability, comparable to the printed paper, have always been two very intimate features.

When I discovered on Adafruit the eink Bonnet with integrated also two control buttons (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4687), I immediately wanted to try to make a project. The size equals to a PiZero, and this stand (https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-zero-stand/), causally found on their blog pushed me to implement this software alarm clock that can make the most in this configuration.

* Hardware needed
* Software stack
